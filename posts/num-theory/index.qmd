## ðŸ“¦ About the Package

**`num_theory`** is a high-performance Python package designed to simplify solving number theory problems â€” especially those from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).  
The primary goal of this project was to gain practical experience in creating and publishing an open-source Python package by following industry best practices.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Features

During the development of this package, we learned how to:

- Manage dependencies using **Poetry**
- Write and run **unit tests**
- Set up a **CI/CD pipeline** to automatically publish to **PyPI**
- Integrate code coverage reporting with **Codecov**
- Structure projects using **Cookiecutter** templates
- Host project documentation on **ReadTheDocs**

The package includes functionalities such as:

- Fast prime number generation
- Primality testing
- Prime factorization
- Arithmetic progression calculations
- A clean and intuitive API for easy use

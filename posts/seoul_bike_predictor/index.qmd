## 🎯 About the Project

In this project, we aimed to build a Docker image from scratch and create a fully reproducible analysis pipeline for future use.  
The primary goal was to learn and practice key software engineering tools, including:

- Setting up Docker images
- Implementing a CI/CD pipeline
- Managing environments using Conda
- Using `make` commands for workflow automation
- Documenting the project using Quarto

We chose a simple dataset for this project, as the main focus was on understanding software tools rather than complex data modeling.

### 📂 About the Data

Rental bikes enhance urban mobility, but predicting their demand is crucial to maintaining a **stable supply**.  
This project uses historical bike rental counts, weather information, and holiday data to forecast hourly bike demand in Seoul.

The dataset was sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) and described in studies by Sathishkumar V E, Jangwoo Park, and Yongyun Cho.

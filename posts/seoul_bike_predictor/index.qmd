## 🎯 About the Project

Rental bikes improve urban mobility, but predicting demand is critical for maintaining a **stable supply**. This project uses historical bike rental, weather, and holiday data to forecast hourly bike demand in Seoul.

The dataset was sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) and described in studies by Sathishkumar V E, Jangwoo Park, and Yongyun Cho.

## 📈 Project Features

- 🔍 Predicts **hourly rental demand** based on weather and calendar variables
- 📦 Fully **Dockerized** environment setup for easy reproducibility
- 🛠 Automated workflows with **Makefile** commands
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model fitting, evaluation
- 📝 Comprehensive reporting and model interpretation

## 🖥️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Pre-requisites

- Docker (latest version)
- Docker Compose
- Conda and Conda-Lock

### 2️⃣ Run the Analysis

**Start Docker Compose**:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Open the link provided (`http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=...`) in your browser to launch JupyterLab.

### 3️⃣ Reset or Rerun the Workflow

**Clean previously generated outputs:**

```bash
make clean
```

**Run the full analysis pipeline:**

```bash
make all
```

**Run individual steps:**

```bash
make dats
make preprocess
make eda
make fit
make evaluate
```

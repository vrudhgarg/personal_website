## üéØ Motivation

For this project, I wanted to build a Shiny application from scratch.  
I downloaded PDF reports from the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) portal and used a PDF extraction library to retrieve the crime data.  
The extracted data was then processed and used to create this interactive dashboard.

This project helped me learn the basics of Shiny app development and gave me hands-on experience working with real-world data sources.

### About the Dashboard

Crime statistics provide valuable insights into public safety and law enforcement effectiveness.  
This dashboard is designed for policymakers, researchers, and local authorities to analyze crime trends across Vancouver neighborhoods.

Using the dashboard, users can:

- Track crime trends over time  
- Compare crime types across neighborhoods  
- Analyze monthly crime patterns  
- Filter and explore data by date, location, and type

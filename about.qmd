I'm Dhruv Garg, a Data Scientist with 3 years of hands-on industry experience and currently pursuing my Master of Data Science at the University of British Columbia. I specialize in designing and deploying machine learning solutions that deliver measurable business value — particularly in marketing analytics and performance optimization.

Previously, I’ve worked with startups and IT consultancies across North America, leading initiatives in large-scale data processing, LLM evaluation, marketing attribution modeling, and cloud-based ETL pipelines. My work has led to improved ROI, reduced infrastructure costs, and streamlined analytics workflows.

In addition to professional roles, I’ve developed open-source packages and interactive dashboards as part of my academic projects, using tools like Dash, Docker, Quarto, and PySpark.

I’m passionate about building intelligent systems that are both scalable and human-centered — and always open to collaborating on impactful data projects.

    "text": "I’m Dhruv Garg, a Data Scientist with 3 years of hands-on industry experience and currently pursuing my Master of Data Science at the University of British Columbia. I specialize in designing and deploying machine learning solutions that deliver measurable business value — particularly in marketing analytics and performance optimization.\nPreviously, I’ve worked with startups and IT consultancies across North America, leading initiatives in large-scale data processing, LLM evaluation, marketing attribution modeling, and cloud-based ETL pipelines. My work has led to improved ROI, reduced infrastructure costs, and streamlined analytics workflows.\nIn addition to professional roles, I’ve developed open-source packages and interactive dashboards as part of my academic projects, using tools like Dash, Docker, Quarto, and PySpark.\nI’m passionate about building intelligent systems that are both scalable and human-centered — and always open to collaborating on impactful data projects."
